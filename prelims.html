 <div id = "history">
	<p id ="year">The precursor to the Internet was jumpstarted in the early days of computing history, in 1969 with the U.S. Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). ARPA-funded researchers developed many of the protocols used for Internet communication today. </br>This timeline offers a brief history of the Internet’s evolution:</br>
 </div>
<button class="accordion"><b>YEAR 1965 - 1969</b></button>    
<div class = "panel" id = "1960">
	</br><b>1965:</b> Two computers at MIT Lincoln Lab communicate with one another using packet-switching technology.</br>
	
	</br><b>1968:</b> Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN) unveils the final version of the Interface Message Processor (IMP) specifications. BBN wins ARPANET contract.</br>
	
	</br><b>1969:</b> On Oct. 29, UCLA’s Network Measurement Center, Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of California-Santa Barbara and University of Utah install nodes. The first message is “LO,” which was an attempt by student Charles Kline to “LOGIN” to the SRI computer from the university. However, the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system crashed.</br>

	</br><b>1972:</b> BBN’s Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The Internetworking Working Group (INWG) forms to address need for establishing standard protocols.</br>
	
	</br><b>1973:</b> Global networking becomes a reality as the University College of London (England) and Royal Radar Establishment (Norway) connect to ARPANET. The term Internet is born.</br>
	
	</br><b>1974:</b> The first Internet Service Provider (ISP) is born with the introduction of a commercial version of ARPANET, known as Telenet. </br>
	
	</br><b>1974:</b> Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn (the duo said by many to be the Fathers of the Internet) publish "A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection," which details the design of TCP.</br>

<button class="accordion"><b>YEAR 1981 - 1989</b></button> 
<div class = "panel" id = "1980">
	</br><b>1981:</b> The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided a grant to establish the Computer Science Network (CSNET) to provide networking services to university computer scientists.</br>

	</br><b>1982:</b> Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET. This results in the fledgling definition of the Internet as connected TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the Internet.</br>

	</br><b>1983:</b> The Domain Name System (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int system for naming websites. This is easier to remember than the previous designation for websites, such as 123.456.789.10.</br>

	</br><b>1984:</b> William Gibson, author of "Neuromancer," is the first to use the term "cyberspace."</br>

	</br><b>1985:</b> Symbolics.com, the website for Symbolics Computer Corp. in Massachusetts, becomes the first registered domain.</br>

	</br><b>1986:</b> The National Science Foundation’s NSFNET goes online to connected supercomputer centers at 56,000 bits per second — the speed of a typical dial-up computer modem. Over time the network speeds up and regional research and education networks, supported in part by NSF, are connected to the NSFNET backbone — effectively expanding the Internet throughout the United States. The NSFNET was essentially a network of networks that connected academic users along with the ARPANET.</br>

	</br><b>1987:</b> The number of hosts on the Internet exceeds 20,000. Cisco ships its first router.</br>

		<p id = "origination">
		The WWW is just one of many applications of the Internet and computer networks.It is based on these three core technologies:
		</br></br>
		<b>HTML</b> - Hypertext Markup Language</b>. HTML originally supported only text documents, but with enhancements during the 1990s grew capable of handling frames,style sheets and plugins for general purpose Web site content publishing.
		</br></br>
		<b>HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b>.  HTTP finally made it to version 2.0 after 20 years, indicative of how well the protocol accommodated the Web's growth.
		</br></br>
		<b>Web servers and Web browsers</b>. The original Netscape has given way to many other browser applications, but the same concepts of client-server communication still apply.
		</br></br>
		Although some people use the two terms interchangeably, the Web is built on top of the Internet and is not the Internet itself. Examples of popular applications of the Internet separate from the Web include</p>

		<h2 id = "tim">Who is Tim-Berners Lee</h2>
		<p id = "timbiography">Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He founded and Directs the World Wide Consortium (W3C) the forum for technical development of the Web. He founded the Web Foundation whose mission is that the WWW serves Humanity, and co-founded the Open Data Institute in London. His research group at MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab ("CSAIL") plans to re-decentralize the Web. Tim spends a lot of time fighting for rights such as privacy, freedom and openness of the Web.
		</br></br>
		A graduate of Oxford University, Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined as Web technology spread.
		</br></br>
		He is the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence ( CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he also heads the Decentralized Information Group (DIG). He is also a Professor in the Electronics and Computer Science Department at the University of Southampton, UK.<a href = "file:///C:/Users/Franchesca/Desktop/WebTechLec-LongtermProject/prelims.html">  Read more..</a></p>

		<div id = "http"><h2>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol <b>by Bradley Mitchell</b></h2>
			<p id = "hypertext">

				<b>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</b> provides a network protocol standard that Web browsers and servers use to communicate.
				</br></br><b>History of HTTP</b></br>
				Tim Berners-Lee created the initial HTTP in the early 1990s as part of his work in defining the original World Wide Web.  Three primary versions were widely deployed during the 1990s
				</br></br>
				<b>
				HTTP 0.9</b> (for support of basic hypertext documents)
				</br></br><b>
				HTTP 1.0</b> (extensions to support rich Web sites and scalability)
				</br></br><b>
				HTTP 1.1</b> (developed to address performance limitations of HTTP 1.0, specified in Internet RFC 2068)
				</br></br>
				The latest version - <b>HTTP 2.0</b> - became an approved standard in 2015. It maintains backward compatibility with HTTP 1.1 but offers additional performance enhancements.
				</br></br>
				While standard <a href = "https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-https-817971">HTTP</a> does not encrypt traffic sent over a network, the HTTPS standard was developed to add encryption to HTTP via the use of (orignially) <a href = "https://www.lifewire.com/secure-sockets-layer-816471">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</a> or (later) Transport Layer Security (TLS).

				</br></br><b>How does HTTP works?</b></br>
				HTTP is an application layer protocol built on top of TCP that uses a client-server communication model. HTTP clients (such as Web browsers) and Web servers communicate via HTTP request and response messages. The three main HTTP message types are GET, POST, and HEAD.
				</br></br>
				<b>HTTP GET</b> messages sent to a Web server contain only a URL. Zero or more optional data parameters may be appended to the end of the URL.
				</br></br>	
				The HTTP server processes the optional data portion of the URL if present and returns the result (a Web page or element of a Web page) to the browser.
				</br></br>	
				<b>HTTP POST</b> messages place any optional data parameters in the body of the request message rather than adding them to the end of the URL.
				</br></br>
				<b>HTTP HEAD</b> request work the same as GET requests.
				</br>
				<div id = "methodshttp">
				Some standard methods of HTTP also includes: <b>PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT</b></br></br>
				<b>PUT</b> - The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.</br>
				<b>DELETE</b> - The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden by human intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location.</br>
				<b>OPTIONS</b> - The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval.</br>
				<b>TRACE</b> - The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop- back of the request message.</br>
				<b>CONNECT</b> - This specification reserves the method name CONNECT for use with a proxy that can dynamically switch to being a tunnel.

				</br>
				</br>
				
				Some extension methods of HTTP also includes: <b> PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK, DESTINATION</b></br></br>
				<b>PROPFIND</b> -  used to retrieve properties, stored as XML, from a web resource. It is also overloaded to allow one to retrieve the collection structure (a.k.a. directory hierarchy) of a remote system.</br>
				<b>PROPPATCH</b> - The PROPPATCH method processes instructions specified in the request body to set and/or remove properties defined on the resource identified by the Request-URI.</br>
				<b>MKCOL</b> - MKCOL creates a new collection resource at the location specified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI is already mapped to a resource, then the MKCOL MUST fail.</br>
				<b>COPY</b> - The COPY method creates a duplicate of the source resource identified by the Request-URI, in the destination resource identified by the URI in the Destination header. The Destination header MUST be present. The exact behavior of the COPY method depends on the type of the source resource.</br>
				<b>MOVE</b> - The MOVE operation on a non-collection resource is the logical equivalent of a copy (COPY), followed by consistency maintenance processing, followed by a delete of the source, where all three actions are performed in a single operation. The consistency maintenance step allows the server to perform updates caused by the move, such as updating all URLs, other than the Request-URI that identifies the source resource, to point to the new destination resource.</br>
				<b>LOCK</b> - Any resource that supports the LOCK method MUST, at minimum, support the XML request and response formats defined herein. This method is neither idempotent nor safe. </br>
				<b>UNLOCK</b> - The UNLOCK method removes the lock identified by the lock token in the Lock-Token request header. The Request-URI MUST identify a resource within the scope of the lock.</br>

				</div>

				<div id = "continuemethods">
				</br>Instead of replying with the full contents of the URL, the Web server sends back only the Web page header information (contained inside the HTML <HEAD> section).
				</br></br>
				The browser initiates communication with an HTTP server by initiating a TCP connection to the server. Web browsing sessions use server port 80 by default although other ports such as 8080 are sometimes used instead.
				</br></br>
				Once a session is established, users of Web browsers trigger the sending and receiving of HTTP messages by visiting Web pages that have HTTP (or HTTPS) URLs.
				</br></br><b>
				Issues with HTTP</b></br>
				Messages transmitted over HTTP can fail to be delivered successfully for several reasons:
				</br></br>
				user error</br></br>
				malfunction of the Web browser</br></br>
				malfunction of  the Web server</br></br>
				errors in creation of Web pages</br></br>
				temporary Internet network glitches</br></br>
		
				When these failures occur, the protocol captures the cause of the failure (if possible) and reports an error code back to the browser. Error 404 ("Page not found"), for example, became famous in the early days of the Internet when issues with Web pages and navigation were more common.
			</div>
			</br>
			<div id = "messageheaders">
			<b>General Header Fields</b></br>
				<b>Cache-Control</b> - used to specify directives for caching mechanisms in both, requests and responses. Caching directives are unidirectional, meaning that a given directive in a request is not implying that the same directive is to be given in the response.</br>
				<b>Connection</b> - The Connection general header controls whether or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes. If the value sent is keep-alive, the connection is persistent and not closed, allowing for subsequent requests to the same server to be done.</br>
				<b>Date</b> - The date and time that the message was originated (in "HTTP-date" format as defined by RFC 7231 Date/Time Formats).</br>
				<b>Pragma</b> - Implementation-specific fields that may have various effects anywhere along the request-response chain.</br>
				<b>Trailer</b> - The Trailer response header allows the sender to include additional fields at the end of chunked messages in order to supply metadata that might be dynamically generated while the message body is sent, such as a message integrity check, digital signature, or post-processing status.</br>
				<b>Transfer-Encoding</b> - Transfer-Encoding is a hop-by-hop header, that is applying to a message between two nodes, not to a resource itself. Each segment of a multi-node connection can use different Transfer-Encoding values. If you want to compress data over the whole connection, use the end-to-end header Content-Encoding header instead.</br>
				<b>Upgrade</b> - Ask the server to upgrade to another protocol.</br>
				<b>Via</b> - Informs the server of proxies through which the request was sent.</br>
				<b>Warning</b> - A general warning about possible problems with the entity body.</br>
